# ðŸš€ LexiDict ðŸ“š

**LexiDict** is a command-line tool that converts **Open English WordNet** data into **JSON** or **CSV**, creating a structured dictionary of words and meanings.

## Features
- Converts **Open English WordNet** data to **JSON** or **CSV**.
- Provides a **dictionary-like structure** with word meanings and relationships.
- Simple command-line interface for easy usage.

## How It Works

LexiDict automatically downloads the latest Open English WordNet XML data from https://en-word.net/ when you run the command. There's no need to manually download or manage the source files - just run the command and LexiDict handles the download, parsing, and conversion process for you. The tool caches downloaded data locally to improve performance on subsequent runs.

```sh
npm install -g lexidict
```
